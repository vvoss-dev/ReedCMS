# ReedCMS

> A high-performance, CSV-based headless CMS built with Rust

## Overview

ReedCMS is a modern headless CMS that prioritises simplicity, performance, and developer experience. It uses CSV files for data storage with O(1) HashMap lookups, delivering sub-millisecond response times.

## Features

- **CSV-Based Storage**: Simple, portable, and version-control friendly
- **Sub-Millisecond Performance**: O(1) HashMap cache with ReedBase
- **Multi-Language Support**: Built-in i18n with language detection
- **Template System**: MiniJinja templates with hot-reload in development
- **RESTful API**: Full HTTP API for external integrations
- **Asset Pipeline**: CSS/JS bundling, minification, and cache busting
- **Security**: Argon2 password hashing, role-based permissions
- **Unix Socket Support**: Production-ready with nginx/apache integration
- **Monitoring**: Built-in performance profiling and health checks

## Architecture

ReedCMS follows a layered architecture:

1. **Foundation Layer**: Core communication (ReedStream)
2. **Data Layer**: CSV storage and caching (ReedBase)
3. **Security Layer**: Authentication and permissions
4. **CLI Layer**: Command-line interface
5. **Template Layer**: MiniJinja rendering
6. **Server Layer**: Actix-Web HTTP server
7. **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints
8. **Asset Layer**: CSS/JS bundling
9. **Build Layer**: Asset pipeline and compilation
10. **Monitor Layer**: Performance monitoring and debugging

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/vvoss-dev/ReedCMS.git
cd ReedCMS
cargo build --release

# 2. Install reed command system-wide
./scripts/setup.sh
# â†’ Will ask for sudo password

# 3. Start development server
reed server:io --port 8333
# â†’ Server runs on http://localhost:8333

# 4. Test commands
reed data:get knowledge.title@en
man reed
```
